A module for [bcc][bcc] that implements [Payment Channels][channel]. Payment channels (sometimes referred as micropayment channels) are a type of smart contracts that allow rapidly adjusting bitcoin transactions. This can be used to do trustless simultaneous payments with a service provider without the need of an intermediary, and some other applications.

See [the main bcc repo][bcc] or the [bcc guide on Payment Channels](http://bcc.io/guide/module/channel/index.html) for more information.
